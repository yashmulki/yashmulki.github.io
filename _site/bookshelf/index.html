Both a fierce moralist who fought the great trusts that dominated American business, and the man who resegregated the civil service, Wilson is revealed to be ___. This fascinating read by Kidder explores the rise of Wilson and his attempts to shape the United States &amp; the world with a decidedly more ambitious</p>

A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East</a>:
 A fascinating account of the people and events surrounding World War I, as it relates to the development of the modern middle
east. I enjoyed the deep dive into the interaction between the British, French, Germans, Ottomans and Russians and their conflicting aims in the regions.
The period in question is amongst the most fascinating periods in recent history.</p>

By now, nearly everyone’s familiar with the Theranos story – a $900 million dollar fraudulent blood testing startup that duped investors and the public for years.
Bad Blood takes you into the story, starting from Theranos’s founding all the way until it’s demise, abounding in intrigue and deception. I couldn’t put this book down.</p>

The Achaemenid Persian Empire was one of the largest in history. King of Kings explores (primarily through the writings of Herodotus and other Greek historians along with other evidence)
how a relatively obscure people came to dominate an area from Afghanistan in the east to the Agean in the west, exploring its leaders, strategies,
and particularly, it’s conflicts with the Greeks. I enjoyed learning about a period in history that I had rarely encountered before.</p>
